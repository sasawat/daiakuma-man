# daiakuma-man
Linux man pages, but every instance of daemon is replaced by DAIAKUMA!!! 

The satanman script provided allows the user to peruse Linux man pages, however, whenever daemon is mentioned, it is replaced with Gabriel DropOut's Satania's catchphrase "DAIAKUMA!!!" This line exceeds 80 characters. How devilish.
